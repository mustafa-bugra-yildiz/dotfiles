Why Commit Mono?
================

I have never seen any other font that promotes conformancy with
practicality as much as these guys do. It looks like every other
tech font and isn't distinct at all.  Easy on the eyes, monospace,
lacks a hype around it. Gets outta my way (son).

Apparently nobody knows about it either, which is surprising
considering that it really is a great font. I intend to keep it
that way.


Setup
=====

```sh
brew install font-commit-mono
```
