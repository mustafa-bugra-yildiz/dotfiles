Why ZSH?
========

It comes with MacOS by default. I just slap https://ohmyz.sh on it
and call it a day.


Setup
=====

```sh
sitdown tools/zsh config > ~/.zshrc
```

```config
# prompt
PS1='%1~: '

# go
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/go/bin"

# homebrew
[ -f /opt/homebrew/bin/brew ] && {
  eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
}
```
