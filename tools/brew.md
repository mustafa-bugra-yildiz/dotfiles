# Why Brew?

Below, you will find a list of package managers I have tried:

- Brew
- Nix

I could have used nix but I am too old right now.
I can't stand picking up another languages.

Plus, a simple `Brewfile` is all I ask anyway.

# Setup

```sh
echo "sync: brew"
rm -f Brewfile
brew bundle dump
```
