Why MacOS?
==========

__Hardware is amazing right now__. Nothing can compare with it.  I
value battery life and longevity to pretty much everything else.
Combine that with the decent performance and the way it syncs with
my other stuff? No brainer if you ask me.

__Software is doable__. I know, it sucks for everything else other
than web dev. But everything just works. Most companies ship native
stuff for this abysmal OS.  And very often I don't need to think
twice before typing `brew install THING`.  It is almost always
there.

__Kinda pricey?__. On the other hand, this is what I do for a living.
It doesn't make sense to cut loose the expenses from where the money
is coming.  At the end of the day, this is one time payment and the
Apple Silicon hardware lasts surprisingly long. Worth.

__It is UNIX__. Strange right? But apparently true. I grew up writing
code on UNIX machines, so MacOS strikes a perfect balance of modern
and old for me.


Setup

I literally don't do anything. It works fine OOTB.

BUT! Apparently this makes fonts look better.
I haven't yet noticed, but we will see.

```sh
defaults write -g CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled -bool NO
```
