Why Vim?
========

Below, you will find an incomplete list of editors I have used:

Old:
- Plain vi
- Vim
- NeoVim
- Emacs
- Notepad++

Weird but cool:
- Kakoune
- Helix

Fast but ugly:
- Sublime Text 4
- Zed

Slow but ok:
- JetBrains X (almost all of them)
- Visual Studio Code
- Cursor

Stupid:
- Visual Studio

Almost all them lacked something. My requirements were simple:


Works OOTB
==========

I couldn't care less about setting things up.

Elimination:
- Plain vi
- Vim
- NeoVim
- Emacs
- Notepad++
- Kakoune


Simple UI
=========

I want it as complicated as I care.

Elimination:
- Visual Studio
- JetBrains X


Fast
====

On a good enough hardware this doesn't matter, but I am very sensitive
to latency for some reason.

Elimination:
- Visual Studio Code
- Cursor


Extensible
==========

I need good extensions.

Elimination:
- Helix
- Sublime Text 4
- Zed


Conclusion
==========

You may have noticed that after all this, I am left with nothing.
That is, everything sucks. Use whatever.


Setup
=====

```sh
[ ! -f ~/.vimrc ] && cp vimrc ~/.vimrc
[   -f ~/.vimrc ] && {
  echo "sync: vim"
  cp ~/.vimrc vimrc
}
```
