Why Terminal.app?
=================

I have literally no reason to use anything else.
And it isn't wrong to stick to defaults when they work.


Setup
=====

Goal: Light background, soft colors, clean mono type.

Settings:
	1.	Open Terminal > Settings > Profiles
	2.	Duplicate the Basic profile and name it Paperlike.

Customize:
	•	Background: #FAFAF7 (a soft, warm white)
	•	Text: #2A2A2A
	•	Font: Set to SF Mono, Berkeley Mono, or Menlo, 13pt–14pt, line height 1.1
	•	Cursor: #D3B65A (soft mustard, optional for a playful touch), non-blinking line.
	•	Selection: Very light grey #EFEFEA
	•	Transparency: 0% (fully opaque, like a real sheet of paper)

Save and set Paperlike as the default.
