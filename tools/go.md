# Go

What else the fuck you want? Dude has everything:

- GC but arenas help out.
- Compiles to static binaries, compile once run anywhere.
- Simplest thing out there.
- Has a library for every fucking thing.
- Templating??? IN THE STANDARD LIBRARY?

Seriously, I just use Go for whatever I am thrown at until it breaks down like a
stupid toddler crying in the corner because he couldn't wear his t-shirt straight.
(Yup, that was _me_ once)

Other than that, I really find anything else to be a nuisance.
JUST USE WHATEVER IS IN THE STANDARD LIBRARY.

You really don't need much. Just good documentation, good tooling.
Whatever man, you will get it right if you are a good engineer anyway.
Don't fret about it much.



## But mby, Go doesn't run on...

What exactly? Mobile? Alright then use something else.
Why do you care about my opinion anyway? I am just a random stranger on the
internet after all.

But seriously, just use Go. And if that doesn't work out you can find an alternative
later on. Its no big deal really. Why? I am glad you asked. Reasoning is as follows:

- be an engineer
- optimize the absolute shit out of everything
- save a lot of time
- stumble on a problem you can't solve in a couple hours
- complain

Do you see the problem here? Use the time you just saved idiot. Business will keep
rolling anyway whether you are here or not (unless its a startup, for which then
you are truly fucked). So just take your time and do it right.

Managers don't know shit about software why care about their artificially conjured
deadlines in the first place? They can write the code themselves for all I care.

> THINK MARK, WHAT WILL YOU HAVE AFTER FIVE-HUNDERED YEARS?

Your father, mother, siblings and every other distant relative I am too forgetful
of their names to type in right now. __Get it over with__.



## Setup

```sh
command -v go >/dev/null || brew install go
```

You won't need much, trust me.
