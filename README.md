# Bugra's Configuration

Hello, this is how I configure my laptop. I'll be a pragmatist, and
give reasons as to why I do what I do per file per tool. The
complete list is below

General:
- [MacOS](/tools/macos.md)
- [Brew](/tools/brew.md)

Coding Related:
- [Cursor](/tools/cursor.md)
- [ZSH](/tools/zsh.md)
- [Ghostty](/tools/ghostty.md)
- [Git](/tools/git.md)

## Tech Stack

You can also find a list of stuff that I use in my everyday life as a developer.
These represent the reality (what I use __now__) then what I think I'll use next.
There are some ideas sprinkled left and right on each of these topics, that's
why I have them as separate articles: to talk about more than _what_ I use
but _why_. The decision making process will help future me and others hopefully.

## Setup

All you have to do is this:

```sh
cat tools/*.md | npx codedown sh | sh
```
