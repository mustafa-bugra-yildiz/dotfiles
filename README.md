## What even is the goal?

To be honest I probably do not know. I know that working with
computers is what I love. Honestly I don't think I could live in a
world without them. But also at the same time, there is so much to
do in this world and I am so young...  I should be out there
experiencing the world to my heart's content yet here I am just
working to death. On one hand it is meaningless, but on the other;
there just isn't anything else left worth doing other than working
my ass off every day.

Regardless of the choices or reasons I list out in this meaningless
repository of my fallible-human-tendency-driven
too-comfortable-to-change-anymore configuration bull-fuckery, it
is a given that I will spend probably a decent chunk of my life
screaming at these soulless, stupid-as-fuck machines. Might as well
make it comfortable...

Or productive, depending on who you ask. I'll probably choose the
dumbest, simplest solution ever and then hype-sell it to the highest
dumb-bidder up above in the economy chain for my own benefit like
a psychopath with no honor or shame.  There is an abundance of those
people I reckon yeah?

Now that I've just read whatever the fuck I happened to spit out
the previous minute, I have never seen truer words spoken WHAT THE
FUCK MOM!!? WHO DID YOU BRING TO THIS GOD-FORSAKEN WORLD AM I A
WIZARD??!?!!?
